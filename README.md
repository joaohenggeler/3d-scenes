# 3D Renders
 
A collection of 3D renders created using [POV-Ray](https://www.povray.org/).

The individual rendered frames are not included for any animations. Use the `BuildVideo.bat` batch file to generate a video after rendering every frame using POV-Ray. This script assumes that [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) exists in the PATH.

## Gallery

This section showcases the rendered scenes and animations.
